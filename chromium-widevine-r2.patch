Minimal patch to get chromium to compile with widevine support.

Exactly the same as -r1, but we now need to patch
ninja to pretty please not terminate our build.

caveat emptor: it's in no way clear that building chromium this
way is safer, from a security perspective, than whatever Google
Chrome does.

Upstream appears to be cooking up a code-signing trust-chain
which may protect users against malicious cdm blobs; I doubt
we benefit from these using this kludge.  Ideally, someone
would look into this more carefully than I have ... tbh as
soon as I got my "stories" back, I pretty much lost interest :)
